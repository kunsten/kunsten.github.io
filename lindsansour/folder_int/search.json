["Larissa Sansour & Søren Lind Tomorrow’s Ghosts 30.3.–20.8.2023 Kunsten UK ","Tomorrow’s Ghosts presents three major works by Larissa Sansour and Søren Lind; Archaeology in Absentia (2016/17), In Vitro (2019), and As If No Misfortune Had Occurred in the Night (2022). Collectively the works address themes such as the aftermaths of mourning, trauma, memory, and loss. Personal experiences intertwine with the collective, and fact and fiction merge. Whilst underlining the impact of political conflict and ecological disasters, they also challenge the foundations of history writing as well as embracing possibilities of rewriting historical narratives. Larissa Sansour (b. 1973) is an award- winning Palestinian artist and director. She studied Fine Arts in London, New York and Copenhagen. Central to Sansour’s work is the dialectics between myth and historical narrative to address social and political issues. In her recent works, she uses science fiction to address social and political issues. Søren Lind (b. 1970) is a Danish author, visual artist, director, and scriptwriter. With a background in philosophy, Lind has published on mind, language, and understanding before turning to fiction, art and film, including novels, short stories and children’s books.

Parents should hold their children’s hand Pay attention to the stairs ","Archaeology in Absentia (2016/17) How can history be rewritten by our actions today? Can we rely on the history and storytelling passed down to us through generations? What defines our understanding of the past? The ten sculptures presented here are part of a larger series of bronze munition replicas modelled on a small Cold War Russian nuclear bomb. The engraving inside each capsule depicts the coordinates of hand-painted porcelain bowls and plates with folkloric patterns. Strategically placed across Palestine/Israel, their longitudes and latitudes were established during real-life burials performed in collaboration with local art institutions. The archaeological artefacts, or porcelain, are not present in this installation. Instead, they are represented Archaeology in Absentia, bronze sculptures, Larissa Sansour and Søren Lind, 2016-17.

When eventually excavated by future archaeologists they will interfere with existing versions of history by unearthing new interpretations and prompting the rewriting of history. In the absence of real peace processes, archaeology has long since become a method for settling land disputes. This installation lends a familiar, yet destructive, shape to the idea of instrumentalized archaeology inspired by the archaeological warfare taking place in the region. In this context archaeology cannot be assumed as a neutral science, but one that fails to represent the complexities of multiple histories related to archaeological artefacts and cultural heritage. In Vitro (2019) Duration: 28 minutes What should be preserved and what should we let go of in the aftermath of a disaster? Are memories and identities transferable between generations? How do they shape us? In Vitro is an Arabic-language sci- fi short set in the aftermath of an eco-disaster. An abandoned nuclear reactor under the biblical town of Bethlehem has been converted into an enormous orchard. Using heirloom seeds collected in the final days before the apocalypse, a group of scientists, sheltering in an underground compound, are preparing to replant the soil above. In the hospital wing of the compound, the orchard’s founder, 70-year-old Dunia, is lying on her deathbed as 30-year-old Alia, comes to visit her. Born underground as part of a comprehensive cloning program, she has only ever known life underground, never experiencing the town she is destined to rebuild. Together they debate the value of memory after the loss of the world above, the intricate relationship between past, present and future, but also the effects of trauma, exile, and nostalgia. This science fiction film merges archival footage, depicting the exodus In Vitro, film, 2 channels, 28’, Larissa Sansour and Søren Lind, 2019.

In the final scene, we witness the re- enactment of a Palestinian tradition of embodying loss by dyeing mourning women’s dresses indigo. The mother steps into a shallow pool, allowing the indigo coloured-water to slowly seep into her white dress, momentarily breaking away from the film’s black and white colour scheme. and displacement of about 700,000 Palestinians during the Palestinian war in 1948, known as the ‘Nakba’. In Vitro was commissioned by the Danish Arts Foundation for the Danish Pavilion Venice Biennial (2019). It was acquired to Kunsten Museum of Modern Art Aalborg’s collection thanks to the generosity of The Augustinus Foundation. As If No Misfortune Had Occurred in the Ni ght (2022 Duration: 21 minutes What is the value of memory after a loss or misfortune? Are we able we keep something alive after it is long lost? In what way can we share tragedies? Staged in a derelict chapel, a Palestinian mother, dressed in a futuristic interpretation of a folkloric Palestinian gown, mourns the loss of her daughter and the succession of traumas passed on to future generations. In this sci-fi film, accompanied by archival war footage, the Palestinian soprano, Nour Darwish, performs a single, poetic Arabic aria adapted from two melancholic compositions; an Arabic modification of Gustav Mahler’s Kindertotenlieder (1904)—devoted to the mournful loss of a child—and a traditional Palestinian song, Al Ouf Mash’al —depicting disaster, exodus, and displacement. The new arrangement laments a century of inherited trauma, starting with the never-ending cycle of violence initiated by World War I, not for only the people of Palestine, who are in permanent limbo waiting for their own history to As If No Misfortune Had Occurred in the Night, 3-channel video, 21’, Larissa Sansour and Søren Lind, 2022.
